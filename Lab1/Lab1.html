            <b>Gabrielle Bonheur "Coco" Chanel</b> (19 August 1883 – 10 January 1971) was a French fashion designer and businesswoman. The founder and namesake of the <b>Chanel brand</b>, she was credited in the post-World War I era with popularizing a sporty, casual chic as the feminine standard of style, replacing the "corseted silhouette" that was dominant beforehand. A prolific fashion creator, Chanel extended her influence beyond couture clothing, realizing her design aesthetic in jewellery, handbags, and fragrance.

    <h2> Perfumes </h2>

    <p>Chanel has created an extraordinary fragrance portfolio which dates back to the 1920s. Here, we take a look at some of the brand’s iconic perfumes, from the legendary Chanel No 5 to the latest update of this classic scent, No 5 L’Eau.</p>

    <p>
        In 1922, Gabrielle Chanel introduced her first parfume Chanel no. 5. Coco was the first designer that actually named her fragrance after something other than the house name. Chanel's perfumer created 10 different perfumes for Coco Chanel. Gabrielle chose number 5, because this was her lucky number and because the scent was divine. After its launch in 1921, No 5. quickly gained fame and became one of most distinct fragrances in the world. The scent was famously worn by Marilyn Monroe, who claimed she only wore No. 5 at night. In 2016 it is still the best-selling fragrance in the world.
